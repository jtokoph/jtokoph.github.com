    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        My name is <strong>Jason Tokoph</strong>. I currently lead the engineering team at <a href="http://www.mozes.com/">Mozes, Inc.</a> and live in San Francisco, CA.
    </p>
    <p>
        My biggest passion is learning about awesome new shit, and creating some of my own. Not surprisingly, my favorite site on the internet is <a href="https://github.com/explore">github</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I don't know more today than I did yesterday, then the day was wasted.
